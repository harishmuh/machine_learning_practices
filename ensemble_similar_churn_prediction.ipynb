        "Currently, the banking industry has grown rapidly, resulting in increasingly fierce competition between banks. One of the challenges banks now face is reducing the number of customers who stop using the company's services and switch to competitors.\n",
        "\n",
        "A bank wants to understand which customers are likely to churn from the bank so that the number of customers who do so can be reduced. A data scientist is asked to create an accurate prediction model to determine whether customers will churn or not using the bank's services using machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Target:\n",
        "\n",
        "0: Never churn\n",
        "\n",
        "1: Stop using the service (churn)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A high percentage of customer churn is one indicator of a bank's failure rate, so efforts are needed to reduce this percentage. Companies generally prefer to retain customers because it costs less to retain customers (customer retention costs) than to acquire new customers (customer acquisition costs). According to information from the internet, acquiring new customers can cost five times more than retaining existing ones. The average customer acquisition cost for the banking industry is around USD 200 per new customer ([source](https://www.skeps.com/blog/how-to-lower-bank-customer-acquisition-costs-skp#:~:text=Bank%20customer%20acquisition%20cost%20is,profit%20margins%20on%20each%20customer.)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Banks can offer retention incentives such as attractive interest rates, attractive service packages, priority service, and other incentives to retain customers. However, retention incentive policies have not been fully implemented effectively. If these incentives are distributed equally to all customers, the costs are ineffective and reduce potential profits if the customer is loyal and does not want to stop using the service.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goals:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the problems above, the company wants to be able to predict whether a customer will stop using the service or not, so it can focus retention efforts on customers who are likely to churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the company wants to understand the factors that influence customer retention so they can develop more targeted programs to reduce churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analytic Approach:**\n",
        "\n",
        "So, what we will do is analyze the data to find patterns that differentiate customers who will churn from those who will not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we will build a classification model that will help the company predict the probability of a customer churning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metric Evaluation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Since our primary focus is customers who will churn, we have set the following targets:\n",
        "\n",
        "Target:\n",
        "- 0: Do not churn\n",
        "- 1: Churn\n",
        "\n",
        "Type 1 error: False Positive (customers who actually do not churn but are predicted to)\n",
        "Consequence: Ineffective retention incentives\n",
        "\n",
        "Type 2 error: False Negative (customers who actually churn but are predicted not to)\n",
        "Consequence: Loss of customers\n",
        "\n",
        "To provide a quantitative overview of the consequences, we will attempt to calculate the cost impact based on the following assumptions:\n",
        "- Customer Lifetime Period for churned customers is approximately 5 years or 60 months\n",
        "- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = USD 200 per customer ([source](https://www.skeps.com/blog/how-to-lower-bank-customer-acquisition-costs-skp#:~:text=Bank%20customer%20acquisition%20cost%20is,profit%20margins%20on%20each%20customer.)) / 60 months = USD 3.33 per month per customer\n",
        "- Customer Retention Cost (CRC) = 1/5 ([source](https://www.outboundengine.com/blog/customer-retention-marketing-vs-customer-acquisition-marketing/)) * CAC = 1/5 * USD 3.33 = USD 0.67 per month per customer\n",
        "- Average Customer Monthly Charge = USD 7 per month per customer ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-avoid-bank-fees/))\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the above assumptions, we can quantify the consequences as follows:\n",
        "- Ineffective retention incentives --> we waste USD 0.67 per month in CRC costs per customer\n",
        "- customer loss --> we lose revenue and also have to re-incur CAC costs, resulting in a total loss of USD 3.33 + USD 7 = USD 10.33 per month per customer\n",
