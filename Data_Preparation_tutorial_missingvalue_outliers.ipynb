        "Depending on the context, outliers either deserve special attention or should be ignored. Take the example of revenue forecasting: if unusual spikes of revenue are observed, it's probably a good ide to pay extra attention to them and figure out what caused the spike. In the same way, an unusual transaction on a credit card might be a sign of fraudulent activity, which is what the credit card issuer wants to prevent. So, in instances like these, it is useful to look for and investigate further the outlier values.\n",
